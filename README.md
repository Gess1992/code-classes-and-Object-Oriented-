# code-classes-and-Object-Oriented-

# use a method def__init__():

#creat a base of the class

#create attributs

--> we will use the formated string instance to support that we can add parameters to the init constructor methode of the animal class.

--> create the instance one you add parameters after self in the unit method , you can actually use those when you instantiate an object base on the class.
